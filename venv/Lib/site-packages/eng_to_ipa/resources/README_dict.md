===========

Language-specific dictionaries use the following IPA notation:

1.  Modern (post '90s) standard IPA notation scheme.
2.  Modern primary and secondary stress marks, placed before the syllable concerned.
3.  A.C. Gimson's quantitative-qualitative notation for vowels, widely regarded and adopted as a de-facto standard.
4.  The IPA zero-width joiner (\u200d) is used between individual diphthong symbols and also between the two affricate phonemes (symbols dʒ and tʃ).
5.  Clive Upton's reforms (OED) are *not* used.
6.  The ligature forms of the affricate phonemes (ʧ) are *not* used.
7.  The IPA over-breve (\u361) is *not* used.
8.  Triphthongs (e.g. /aɪə/ (fire) and /aʊə/ (power)) are used in the dictionary files but are replaced with diphthongs by default in results.
9.  Currently there is no policy adopted around the use of the Longman Dictionary tense short vowels /i/ (happy) and /u/ (situation).

For English-language IPA, this translates to:
*  The consonants /p, t, k, b, d, f, v, s, z, m, n, r, l, w, h/
*  /x/ as used in Scottish, Welsh and foreign-origin words, e.g. loch.
*  The consonants /g, tʃ, θ, ʃ, ŋ, dʒ, ð, ʒ, j/ 
*  The short vowels /ɪ, e, æ, ʊ, ʌ, ɒ, ə/
*  The long vowels /ɑː, iː, uː, ɜː, ɔː/
*  The diphthongs /eɪ, aɪ, ɔɪ, ɪə, eə, əʊ, aʊ, ʊə/
